MyVakeel - Generative AI for Legal Document Demystification
üí° The Problem
Legal documents are intentionally complex, filled with jargon and hidden clauses that make them impossible for the average person to understand. This creates a massive information gap, exposing individuals and small business owners to unnecessary financial and legal risks. Our goal is to bridge this gap, making legal information accessible, clear, and safe.

üöÄ The Solution
MyVakeel is a web-based, AI-powered tool that acts as a personal legal assistant. It allows users to securely upload legal documents (like insurance policies or claims) and instantly receive a simplified summary, a risk analysis, and a visual mind map of the key terms. We built this project to demonstrate how generative AI can be used to empower people and protect them from hidden risks in their everyday lives.

‚ú® Key Features
Secure Document Analysis: Users can upload PDF and image files of legal documents. Our application uses Google's multimodal generative AI to process the documents and provide a comprehensive analysis.

Plain-Language Summary: The AI generates a clear, easy-to-read summary of the entire document, translating complex legal language into simple, bulleted points.

Risk Identification: Our tool intelligently highlights dangerous or hidden clauses, such as those related to liability, exclusions, or claims. For each risk, it provides the original text and a simple explanation of why it is a concern.

Interactive Chatbot: A contextual chatbot allows users to ask specific questions about the uploaded document, getting real-time, helpful answers without needing to navigate the entire legal text.

Secure Data Storage: The application securely stores all uploaded documents and AI analyses in a Firebase Firestore database, ensuring that all user data is private and confidential.

Visual Representation: The AI generates a text-based "mind map" that visually represents the key concepts and dependencies within a document, making it easier to understand at a glance.

üíª Tech Stack
